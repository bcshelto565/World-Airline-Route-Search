TO RUN THE PROGRAM THAT HANDLES PROBLEMS 1 AND 2:

NOTES: This program uses flight.txt to load in the graph nodes and its edges and is necessary for the project.
The file will be provided but it was generated by the given graphGen.cpp and therefore can be tested by other flight.txt(s). 
Additionally, the program will report that a node does not exist if the user types in the city name incorrectly or if it does not exist.

All city Inputs are case sensitive. Make sure that they match the exact formatting of the cities listed in the city.name file.
FOR ALL CITY INPUTS: Format is: City Name, Country Name
EXAMPLE CITY: New York City, United States

1. g++ adjcencyList.cpp
2. ./a.out
3. A menu will display to either run poblem 1 by entering 1, problem 2 by entering 2, or print the adjcency list by entering 3. 
0 will be the choice if you wish to quit the program

TO RUN THE PROGRAM THAT HANDLES PROBLEMS 3 AND 4:

To compile the code go to terminal containing the files and type:
"g++ WA.cpp -o wa.cpp"
then type and enter
"./wa.cpp"
Then when confronted with the question of which task is being used type either 3 or 4 and the program will ask for inputs based on the task.
the program will automatically close after completing a task. To run again simply run ./wa.cpp and follow the menus again.
